# This is a prototype level of a set theory proof game

## Use
### UI
*	Intersection
	*	Drag sets from the top right into the two slots in the intersection operator, then drag the operator itself into the box of sets to perform the intersection, and create a new set

	*	Facts
		*	Drag a set into empty space in the large triangle to make an assertion about that set.
		*	Drag an element into the middle square within the triangle to claim that this element is inside the specified set
		*	Drag facts from the list of facts on the left into the empty space in the triangle to use them as your justifications for the assertion you are making
		*	When you have chosen a set, element, and justifying facts, drag the entire triangle into the fact list on the left to create your new fact!
			*	These can now be used as justifications for new facts!
			*	Prove the claim at the bottom to win!
